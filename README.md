# MTG-ELO
Python program that auto calculates ELO for two player MTG decks. This project started out as a simple terminal input and now is a full program with an executable file. Please see the elo_example.xlsx to see sample match outputs. Initial spreadsheet set-up should include the first two rows with initial rankings and neutral match results.
